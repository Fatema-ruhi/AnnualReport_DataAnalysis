# AnnualReport_DataAnalysis
‚ÄúThis project showcases my data analysis of the Missouri Office of Equal Opportunity FY23 Annual Report. I extracted, cleaned, and analyzed quantitative data from data warehouses using SQL, created summary tables and visuals using Tableau, and Excel, to provide insights on workforce demographics and diversity metrics.‚Äù

## üìä Data Extraction and Analysis Process

### üîπ Data Extraction

I extracted raw data directly from internal **data warehouses** using **SQL**. This involved writing complex queries with **JOINs**, **window functions (ROW\_NUMBER)**, **partitioning**, and **filters** to retrieve workforce and business certification data.
‚û°Ô∏è **Example SQL Query**:
*A sample query is provided in the `sql_queries/` folder (or see below).*



### üîπ Data Cleaning and Processing

* After extraction, I cleaned and pre-processed the data using Tableau Prep and Excel.
* Tasks included:

  * Removing duplicates and irrelevant records.
  * Filtering by certification status and date ranges.
  * Handling missing values in county and region mappings.
  * Formatting data for visualization-ready use.

### üîπ Dashboarding and Visualization

* Built **interactive dashboards** in **Tableau Desktop** to visualize: (A sample of a Tableau Dashoboard: https://github.com/Fatema-ruhi/AnnualReport_DataAnalysis/blob/main/Dashboard%201%20overall.png).

  * Certification distribution by county, region, and business sector.
  * Trends in workforce diversity and business status.
  * Year-over-year changes and breakdowns by business classification codes.

* Created **summary tables and charts** aligned with reporting standards from the [FY23 OEO Annual Report](https://oeo.mo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fy23-annual-report-final.pdf).

---

‚úÖ **Result**: A fully automated pipeline starting from SQL-based raw data extraction, through data cleaning and transformation, to end-to-end reporting with **Tableau dashboards** and **Excel summaries**.

Let me know if you want me to **generate this full README for you** with folder structure suggestions!

  * Tables and visualizations: Include the key tables you created or graphs that summarize findings.
  * Summary and insights: Brief text blocks explaining what the data shows.

#### 3. **Add the Original Annual Report Link**

* Put the link in the README file and mention that this is the source document you analyzed.

#### 4. **Write a Detailed README**

* Explain:

  * Your role in the analysis.
  * Tools and techniques used (e.g., Python libraries like `pandas`, `tabula-py` for PDF extraction, Excel, R, Tableau).
  * What parts of the report you analyzed and why.
  * Key findings or outcomes.
  * How this project demonstrates your data science skills.

#### 5. **Optional: Include Sample Data or Processed Tables**

* If you can legally share, upload CSV files with cleaned quantitative data or sample tables.

#### 6. **Use GitHub Pages or Notebooks Viewer for Presentation**

* GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks and Markdown files beautifully so recruiters can view your analysis directly in the browser.
* Optionally, set up GitHub Pages for a simple project website with your summary.
