“This project showcases my data analysis of the Missouri Office of Equal Opportunity FY23 Annual Report. I extracted, cleaned, and analyzed quantitative data from the report, created summary tables and visuals using SQL, Tableau, and Excel, to provide insights on workforce demographics and diversity metrics.”
